# Deno Markdown Journal

Just playing with Deno for something different.

Using the following to make this up:
- https://deno.com/deploy/docs/serve-static-assets
- https://deno.land/x/markdown@v2.0.0
- https://reactgo.com/deno-check-file-exists/

No, I'm not saying this is good. I just wanted to see if it was possible and how it would work.
